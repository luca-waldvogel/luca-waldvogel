Hi, Iâ€™m @luca-waldvogel.
In September 2024, I started my part-time training as a Software Developer, earning the Federal VET Diploma (EFZ). 
Prior to this, I had already taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS and have since worked on small C++ projects.
Alongside my training, I am continuously working to expand my knowledge and skills.
